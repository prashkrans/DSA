/* Queue Problem #3 - LC#232. Implement Queue using Stacks
Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support
all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyQueue class:
1.	void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
2.	int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
3.	int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
4.	boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and 
is empty operations are valid. 

Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized O(1) time complexity? In other words, 
performing n operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer.

Constraints:
1 <= x <= 9
At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
All the calls to pop and peek are valid.

//	Method 2: Using two stacks along with a variable front to store the first element. [#IMP]
//	Also, here data of s2 is not transferred back to s1 rather, we wait for s2 to become empty.
//	Read the solution to #232 to understand better:
//	a. push(): 
//	Time complexity : O(1) –êppending an element to a stack is an O(1) operation.
//	Space complexity : O(n)O(n). We need additional memory to store the queue elements
//	b. pop():
//	Time complexity: Amortized O(1), Worst-case O(n).
//	Space complexity : O(1)O(1).
//	c. empty(): R.T. = O(1), A.S. = O(1)
//	d. front(): R.T. = O(1), A.S. = O(1)
