/*DP-Problem 3 (LC#1143) :
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no
common subsequence, return 0. A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string
with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example 1:
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

#IMP - It is one of the most important DP problems which can be used to solve other DP problems such as
the longest palindromic sequence, etc.
