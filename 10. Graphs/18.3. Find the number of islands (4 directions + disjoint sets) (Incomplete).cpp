/* Graph problem #21.3. Find the no. of islands
Given a grid consisting of '0's(Water) and '1's(Land). Find the number of islands.
Note: An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or
vertically or diagonally i.e., in all 8 directions.

There are three methods to solve this:
1.	Using a simple DFS
2.	Using a simple BFS
3.	Using disjoint sets i.e. union-find algorithm
