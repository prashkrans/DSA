/* Graph problem #32.2. Rat in a Maze (Any path)
A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block
is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two
directions: forward and down. Print any path along which the rat can escape the maze.
In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination. Note that
this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem. For example, a more complex version can be that the rat can move in 4 directions
and a more complex version can be with a limited number of moves.

This problem could be solved using two methods:
1.  Backtracking: R.T. = A.S. = O(2^(n^2)) i.e. exponential thus, inefficient
2.  BFS or DFS: R.T. = A.S. = O(n^2)
*/

//  Method 2. Using BFS or DFS to find any single path in which the rat could escape the maze. Here, BFS is used.
//  Note: This method only gives a single and does not give all the paths along which the rat could escape the maze.
//  However: This method is faster O(n^2) than backtracking O(c^(n^2)) where c is the no. of directions allowed. So, when just a
//  single path is required it is better to use BFS or DFS than backtracking.
//  Also, no concept of shortest path exists here when only two (R, D) directions are allowed, i.e. all the paths are
//  the shortest paths from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1) of equal lengths = ((n-1)-0 + (n-1)-0) = 2n-2. Eg. n = 3 => length = 2*3-2 = 4.

//  Running time = O(BFS or DFS) = O(n^2) = O(V) since we are using a matrix to represent the maze where each cell acts as a node.
//  Auxiliary space = O(number of cells) = O(n^2) or O(V) due to the queue, visited and the parent array.
