/* Graph problem #21.2. Find the no. of islands
Given a grid consisting of '0's(Water) and '1's(Land). Find the number of islands.
Note: An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or
vertically or diagonally i.e., in all 8 directions.

There are three methods to solve this:
1.	Using a simple DFS
2.	Using a simple BFS
3.	Using disjoint sets i.e. union-find algorithm
*/

//	Method 2 - Using BFS traversal to mark a node visited in each island
//	Steps: Refer notes
//	Running time = O(BFS) = O(n*m) since we traverse through the given matrix/grid
//	Auxiliary space = O(1) if the given matrix/grid itself is modified to keep track of visited nodes
//					or O(n*m) if we create a new visited matrix
