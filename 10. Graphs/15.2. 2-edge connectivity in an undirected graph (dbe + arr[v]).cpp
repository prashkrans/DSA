/* Graph problem #18.2. 2-edge connectivity in an undirected graph
Given an undirected graph G, with V vertices and E edges, check whether the graph is 2-edge connected or not.

A graph is said to be 2-edge connected if,
a.	on removing any edge of the graph, it still remains connected,
b. 	or it contains no bridges.

Bridge: Such an edge whose removal disconnects a graph is called a bridge.

It can be solve using three methods:
1.	Naive solution: Remove each edge turn by turn and do a BFS/DFS to see if the graph is still connected.
	R.T. = O(m)*O(BFS/DFS) = O(m*(n+m)) ~ O(m^2) i.e. quadratic in no. of edges thus, inefficient
2.	Number of edges connected to each node: (Easiest solution)
	R.T. = O(n+m) ~ O(m) i.e. traversal of all the edges
3.	Using deepest backedge + arrival time: (Best solution)
	R.T. = O(DFS) = O(n+m) ~ O(m)
*/

//	Method 3. Using deepest backedge + arrival time + one DFS traversal
//	Note - In a DFS tree representation of an undirected graph, there are only two types of edges
//	a. 	Tree edges 	
//	b.	Back edges
//	It does not have forward edges or cross edges. So, if all the subtrees have atleast one back edge going out
//	it implies that the undirected graph G is 2-edge connected.
//	It is quite similar to strong connectivity in directed graphs i.e. if all the subtrees have atleast one edge 
//	(whether a back edge or a cross edge) going out of them, => G is strongly connected.
//	Steps: Refer notes

//	Running time = O(DFS) or O(m+n) ~ O(m)
//	Auxiliary space = O(n) or O(V)
