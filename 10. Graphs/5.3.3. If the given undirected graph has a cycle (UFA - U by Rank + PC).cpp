/*	Graph Problem #8.3.3. - Given an undirected graph, find whether it has a cycle.
    This problem could be solved using three methods
    1.  DFS + parent variable
    2.  BFS + parent array
    3.  Union-find algorithm    (Avoid using find() and union() instead use findSet() and unionOfSets())
        1.  Naive                                   O(n)
        2.  Union by rank/height                    O(log2(n))      modify just unionOfSets() to allow union by rank or height
        3.  Union by rank + Path Compression        O(l)            modify both findSet() to allow path compression and unionOfSets() to allow union by rank or height
*/

//	Method 3.3. Using the union-find algorithm + Path Compression (Union by rank or height i.e. find() = O(1) and union() = O(1))
//  Here, we are using union by rank along with path compression to use the union-find algorithm
//  Steps: The process remains the same as for a naive union-find algo except that we optimize the find() and union() operations.
//  a.  Assume in the beginning that each vertex is in a different set => no. of sets = no. of vertices
//  b.  Pick any edge joining two vertices say vi and vj. Merge the sets containing vi and vj into a single set.
//      Note: If an edge e(u, v) is picked, make sure not to pick the edge e(v, u) since it is an undirected graph.
//      Hence, create an array/map that stores a pair<T, T>. Also, unordered_map and unordered_set don't work with pairs
//  c.  Repeat the step a. until
//      i.  All the edges are picked and each time an edge was picked the number of sets reduced by 1 eventually becoming
//          equal to the no. of connected components in the graph thus implying that the given undirected graph is acyclic.
//      ii. Or, when a particular edge is picked joining two vertices say vi and vj, both of which belong to the same set thus
//          implying that the given undirected graph is cyclic.

//	Running time = O((m*2*Find()) + (Union()*(n-1))) = O(2mF + U(n-1)) ~ O(mF + Un) = O(m.1 + 1.n) ~ O(n+m) ~ O(m) if m > n
//	Auxiliary space = O(n) or O(V) i.e. the max size of the summation of sizes of all the disjoint sets = no. of vertices
