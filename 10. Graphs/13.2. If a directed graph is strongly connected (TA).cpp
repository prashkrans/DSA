/* Graph problem #16.2. Strong Connectivity in a directed graph (Tarjan's Algo).
Given a directed graph, find whether it is strongly connected.
Note - This graph has either a single SCC or multiple SCCs.
If the G has a single SCC, return true
else return false


There are three methods to find if a directed graph is strongly connected.
1. 	Naive solution: n*DFS => R.T. = O(nm) or O(n^3) thus, inefficient.
2.	Another naive solution: Using transitive course or Floyd Warshall algorithm => R.T. = O(n^3) again, inefficient.
3.	Kosaraju algorithm: Developed by S. Rao Kosaraju (IITKGP). Here R.T. = O(m) but uses 2 DFS
4.	Tarjan's algorithm: Here R.T. = O(m) but uses a single DFS
*/

//	Method 4. shortest arrival time (sat) + arrival array + one DFS traversal
//  This method is the same as Tarjan's Algo except for variables used (For a single SCC)
//  This works on the principle that the necessary and sufficient condition for a directed graph to be strongly
//  connected is that an edge goes out of every subtree in DFS representation of the graph. The edge could be
//  a back edge or a cross edge(right to left) as directed graphs contain cross edges too.
//  The algo is exactly the same as that for 2-edge/2-vertex connectivity where the variable dbe was used, while
//  here we use sat i.e. the node with the shortest arrival time to which the outgoing edge from a subtree points to.
//  Steps:

//	Running time = O(DFS) = O(n+m) ~ O(m)
//	Auxiliary space = O(n) or O(V)
