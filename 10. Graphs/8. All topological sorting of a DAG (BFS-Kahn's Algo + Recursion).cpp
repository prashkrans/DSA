/*	Graph Problem #11. - All Topological Sorts of a Directed Acyclic Graph
	Given a DAG, print all topological sorts of the graph.
*/
	
//	Method 1 - Using Kahn's Algo + Recursion (Top-down approach)	
//	In a directed acyclic graph many a times we can have vertices which are unrelated to each other 
//	because of which we can order them in many ways. We can go through all possible ordering via 
//	recursion and backtracking , the algorithm steps are as follows : 
//	Steps:
//	1.	Initialize all vertices as unvisited.
//	2.	Now choose vertex v which is unvisited and has zero indegree and decrease indegree of all 
//		out adjacent vertices w of v by 1
//	3.	Now add this vertex to result and call the recursive function again and backtrack.
//	4.	After returning from function, reset values of visited, result and indegree for enumeration of other possibilities.
//	5. 	The base case of the recursion is that if the size of the result = no. of vertices, which means that all the nodes
//		have been visited in the current branch, i.e. a ts is completed then, print the current result (ts)

//	Running time = O(n!) or O(V!) i.e. factorial. Note - O(n!) > O(2^n) after n = 3;
//	Auxiliary space = O(n) or O(V). Since, the size of visited, result, indegree are all n or V
