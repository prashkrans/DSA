/*	Graph Problem #4 - Depth First Search (DFS)
	DFS works for both directed and undirected graphs.
	The processing order of the nodes in DFS is the exact opposite order as how they were added to the 
	stack, which is Last-in-First-out(LIFO). That's why we use a stack in DFS.
	
	DFS can be implemented using:
a.	a stack (i.e. iterative DFS similar to how BFS uses a queue)
	The advantage of the recursion solution is that it is easier to implement. However, there is a huge 
	disadvantage: if the depth of recursion is too high, you will suffer from stack overflow. 
	In that case, you might want to use BFS instead or implement DFS using an explicit stack.
	
b.	recursion (i.e. recursion stack)
	It seems like we don't have to use any stacks when we implement DFS recursively. But actually, 
	we are using the implicit stack provided by the system, also known as the Call Stack.
	It is easier to implement than using an explicit stack for DFS.

	The first path found in DFS is not always the shortest path, unlike BFS.

//	Running time = O(n+m) = O(V+E) as summation over (v + degree(v))
//	But in a connected graph m >= n-1 hence it becomes O(m) or O(E)
//	Auxiliary space = O(n) or O(V). Since, an extra visited array is needed of size V
//	Note - However the space reqd. for adjacency matrix is O(n+m) (average cases) & O(n^2) (worst case)
