/* Graph problem - 28. LC#752. Open the Lock
You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. 
The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning
one wheel one slot.
The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.
You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning 
and you will be unable to open it.
Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open 
the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.

Example 1:
Input: deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
Output: 6
Explanation:
A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" -> "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202" would be invalid,
because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end "0102".

Constraints:
1 <= deadends.length <= 500
deadends[i].length == 4
target.length == 4
target will not be in the list deadends.
target and deadends[i] consist of digits only.

BFS is used for the solution here. Since BFS gives the shortest path in an unweighted graph, we can use it to get to 
the target starting from "0000". If a deadend value is encountered, that path is not considered to reach the target 
i.e. a deadend value is not an adjacent node of the current node u. So, each value of the lock (u) would have 8 
potential neighbours (v) if v is not a deadend.
Now, each node v is searched for in deadends vector which takes O(x) where x is the size of the deadends vector.
So, it is better to convert the vector deadends to an unordered_map or unordered_set so that node v can be looked up
in O(1) time instead of O(x) time.
