/* Graph problem #15. - Maximum number of edges to be added to a tree so that it stays a Bipartite graph
Given a undirected tree, compute the maximum no. of edges that can be added to the tree so that it
remains a bipartite graph. Note - A tree by definition is connected.
*/

//	Method 1 - BFS + 2 Colours (say red-1 and blue-0)
//	Steps:
//	1.	Do a simple BFS traversal of graph and color it with two colors.
//	2.	While coloring also keep track of counts of nodes colored with the two colors. Let the two counts be
//		count_blue0 and count_red1.
//	3.	Now we know maximum edges a bipartite graph can have are count_blue0 x count_red1.
//	4.	We also know a tree with n nodes has n-1 edges. So, the answer is (count_blue0 x count_red1 â€“ (n-1)).
//	4b.	If a graph was given instead of a tree, then count the no. of edges in the graph say noOfEdges.
//		So, the answer would be (count_blue0 x count_red1 - noOfEdges)

//  Running time = O(BFS) or O(n+m) ~ O(m)
//  Auxiliary space = O(n) or O(V)
