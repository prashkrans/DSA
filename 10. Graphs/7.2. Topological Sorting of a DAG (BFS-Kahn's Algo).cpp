/*	Graph Problem #10.2. - Topological Sorting
	Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices
	such that for every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
	Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.
	There are two methods to obtain the topological sorting of a DAG:
		1. 	DFS + Stack
		2.	BFS + Indegree array (Kahn's Algorithm)
		R.T of both = O(n+m) ~ O(m)
*/

//	Method 2 - Using BFS algo + indegree array (Kahn's algorithm)
//	This algo is based on the property that:
//	"a DAG G has at least one vertex with in-degree 0 and one vertex with out-degree 0"
//	Proof: Thereâ€™s a simple proof to the above fact is that a DAG does not contain a cycle which means that all
//	paths will be of finite length. Now let S be the longest path from u(source) to v(destination). Since S is the
//	longest path there can be no incoming edge to u and no outgoing edge from v, if this situation had occurred then S
//	would not have been the longest path => indegree(u) = 0 and outdegree(v) = 0
//	Steps:
//	1. 	Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the graph and
//		initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.
//	2. 	Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)
//	3.	Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.
//		a.	Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
//		b. 	Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
//		c.	If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue.
//	4. 	Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.
//	5.	Iff count of visited nodes is equal to the number of nodes in the graph then topological sort is possible
//		for the given graph

//	Running time = O(BFS) = O(n+m) = O(V+E) which becomes O(m) or O(E) if m>=n
//	Auxiliary space = O(n) or O(V) due the indegree[] array
//	Running time = O(n+m) ~ O(m) or O(E)
//	Auxiliary space = O(n) or O(V) due to the size of the visted array and the stack
