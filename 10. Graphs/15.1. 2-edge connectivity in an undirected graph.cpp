/* Graph problem #18.1. 2-edge connectivity in an undirected graph
Given an undirected graph G, with V vertices and E edges, check whether the graph is 2-edge connected or not.

A graph is said to be 2-edge connected if,
a.	on removing any edge of the graph, it still remains connected,
b. 	or it contains no bridges.

Bridge: Such an edge whose removal disconnects a graph is called a bridge.

It can be solve using three methods:
1.	Naive solution: Remove each edge turn by turn and do a BFS/DFS to see if the graph is still connected.
	R.T. = O(m)*O(BFS/DFS) = O(m*(n+m)) ~ O(m^2) i.e. quadratic in no. of edges thus, inefficient
2.	Number of edges connected to each node: (Easiest solution)
	R.T. = O(n+m) ~ O(m) i.e. traversal of all the edges
3.	Using deepest backedge + arrival time: (Best solution)
	R.T. = O(DFS) = O(n+m) ~ O(m)
*/

//	Method 2. Using number of edges connected to each node.
//	Since the given graph is undirected, the problem can be solved only by counting the number of edges
//	connected to the nodes. If for any of the nodes, the number of edges connected to it is 1 it means on
//	removing this edge the node becomes disconnected and it canâ€™t be reached from any other node therefore
//	the graph is not 2-edge connected.
//	Steps:
//		1.	Create an array noOfEdges[] of size V which will store the number of edges connected to a node.
//		2.	For every ordered pair edge (u, v) increment the number of edges for node u only.
//		3.	Now iterate over the array noOfEdges[] and check if any node has only 1 edge connected to it.
//			a.	If yes then the graph is not 2-edge connected.
//			b.	Otherwise, the graph is 2-edge connected.
